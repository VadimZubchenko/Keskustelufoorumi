    <h1>1980's Home Computers</h1>
    <p>In early 1980's, home computers became mainstream. For the first time, computers could be
        purchased by an average family household.</p>

        <h2>Clever uses</h2>
    <p>The main usage for a home computer was, of course, games. As cool games may not be a valid reason
        for purchasing an expensive gadget, a wide variety of potential uses were invented to satisfy those
        family members who might otherwise be sceptical.</p>
        <p>Some reasons often mentioned were:</p>
        <ul>
            <ol>learning to write computer programs</ol>
            <ol>managing family finances</ol>
            <ol>keeping track of freezer contents</ol>
        </ul>

    <h2>Legendary computers</h2>
    <p>The best known computer of the eighties was Commodore 64, but there are other computers that gained popularity.</p>

    <h2>Key concepts</h2>
    <p>The hardware charateristics of a home computer could be defined by its graphics and sound capabilities, CPU, and amount of memory.</p>
        <p>There are two types of memory:</p>

        <dl>
            <dt><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ram">RAM</a></dt>
            <dd>Random access memory. The memory usable by programs. The amount was typically
                in the ballpark of 20 to 64 kilobytes. However, the Basic interpreter by default
                consumed a part of this.</dd>

            <dt><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read-only_memory">ROM</a></dt>
            <dd>Read-only memory. This was normally smaller in size than RAM and roughly
                corresponded to the hardware implementation of the operating system.</dd>
